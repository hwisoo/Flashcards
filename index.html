        <div class="container">
                
        <div class="mainContent">
            <div class="row">
                    <div class="card col-md-2 word">Javascript</div>
                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.
                    </div>
                </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="card col-md-2 word">Operators</div>
                <div class="card col-md-9 def">JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.</div>
            </div>
       

            <div class="row">
                <div class="card col-md-2 word">Variables</div>
                <div class="card col-md-9 def">Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="card col-md-2 word">Varaiable naming Conventions</div>
                <div class="card col-md-9 def">You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a variable name. For example, break or boolean variable names are not valid.
                    JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one.
                    JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and name are two different variables.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row">
                    <div class="card col-md-2 word">Functions</div>
                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="card col-md-2 word">Methods</div>                        
                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. </div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="card col-md-2 word">Arguments</div>                            
                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">The arguments object is a local variable available within all non-arrow functions. You can refer to a function's arguments inside that function by using its arguments object. It has entries for each argument the function was called with, with the first entry's index at 0.</div>

                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">A function can have one or more parameters, which will be supplied by the calling code and can be used inside a function. JavaScript is a dynamic type scripting language, so a function parameter can have value of any data type.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="card col-md-2 word">Return</div>                            
                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined by default.</div>
                </div>

                    <div class="card col-md-2 word">Chaining methods</div>              
                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, refers to repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. This technique abounds in jQuery and other JavaScript libraries and it is even common in some JavaScript native methods.</div>

                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">Boolean is a primitive data type in JavaScript. Boolean can have only two values, true or false. It is useful in controlling program flow using conditional statements like if..else, switch, while, do..while.</div>

                    <div class="card col-md-9 def">Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="row">
